When the thunder began roaring my body convulsed. A sharp pain in my left temple, as if I have bitten on a cold metal sheet. This was new. Since Doc Newland butched up the datajack implant, I had problems with my optical nerves playing tricks on me, producing colors that were not there, even colors I haven't seen before in my life. I learned to live with this for the last week, but now my auditory systems were more sensitive than they used to be.
