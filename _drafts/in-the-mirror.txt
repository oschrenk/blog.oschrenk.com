In the mirror I saw not my reflection, but that of a different man. A man that knows how to solve problems, a man that recognizes a person in need, a man that hasn't lost his friend.
He was a bit taller than me. Stood upright. There was no guilt pulling him down. His left temple was not surrounded by the grey hairs. Does guilt do that to you? You grow lifeless, grey appendages out of your skull? The shoulders were straight. He didn't try to commit suicide and did not only manage to crush his shoulder blade while the car wrapped itself around the huge birch.
