When I lay awake at night it's often because I fear my own dreams. When I'm awake I can drown out my mind, I can play music, I can let the people on the television pretend that they are my friends, I can read jokes, I can read news articles. But when I sleep my mind takes over and I fear that it might realize some things I'm trying hard not to.
