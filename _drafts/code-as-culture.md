# Code as Culture #

We are developers. Code is our way to communicate with the world, it is how we bring thoughts into reality. Sure we all may use different languages and accents to express ourselves, we might not even understand each other, but there are our connection to the physical world.

But as always it is about communication. It does not suffice to tell the machine what to do. We should talk to each other about code, evolve our language capabilities by picking up new vocabulary and new phrases. The ability to express our thoughts can't evolve if they aren't questioned.
