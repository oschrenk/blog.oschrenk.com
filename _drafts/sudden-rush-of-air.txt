There was a sudden rush of air through the smallest of crevice. Air meant outside, meant movement, meant hope for escape. Maybe my capturers were pumping the sweet mixture of molecules in my dark cavern to give me hope. I felt around. Even if it was just their latest game, it still was change, something to occupy my brain with besides my own thoughts. After weeks of darkness and silence the brain gets bored and invents colors and noise. Maybe this is is a game of my own invention, without me knowing it, my brain craving for stimulation. Even if it is, there is nothing else. I gave in. I felt around, but couldn't find the source. I definitely felt my hairs on my leg being moved by a a wave of air, but now nothing. Maybe it was a spider? But even a spider meant that there was a way in and a way out.
