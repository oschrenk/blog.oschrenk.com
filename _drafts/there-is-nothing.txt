Before time there was Nothing. It was when the idea of Everything was the same as the idea of Nothing, Nothing is not a bad thing. Most people don't know what nothing can do for you. Every thing comes out of nothing. Nothing is the breeding ground of information, a brewing in which bubbles of energy pop into and out of existence. Sometimes a bubble is lucky and gets big enough, separates itself from the others and then from the surface and becomes different. That is what Something is, being different from Nothing. When Something gets born from Something, you get the idea of Everything. Everything encompasses The Nothing and the Something.
